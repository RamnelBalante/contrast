# contrast
Add CSS styling to this simple HTML page to bring in the principles of contrast. Think carefully of what elements you want to stand out and bring attention to, and what elements can fade into the background. What's the hierarchy order of the headings, ie, what's your focal points? Does that show visually? You can edit the HTML if needed, but the content, titles, and images must remain the same.

List 2 things you purposely did to create effective contrast.

When finished, zip up the project folder and upload it to Moodle. Be sure to include your list of 2 things in the Online Text area.
